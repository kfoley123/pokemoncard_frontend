## Description

The purpose of designing this app was to develop my back end and database creation skills. Original version of the app had full CRUD functionality so card could be updated, added or deleted, but it didn't make sense to keep all these functions for general users, so most of these have been removed or limited to "admin" account user.

The App alows users to view all Pokemon cards that have been added to the database, sort them by different filters (i.e type and/or specifc card set) and create a user if signed out. When signed in, users can create their own collections of cards.

TODO:

-   update CSS to work on mobile
-   optomize for accessibility
-   Add filter for Pokedex Index
-   Add effect so current page is highlighted in the nav
