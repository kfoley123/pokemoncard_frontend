## Description

This app is made up of a React front-end and a Django Rest back-end (https://github.com/kfoley123/pokemonCardDjango). Users can view all Pokemon cards that are in the database, as well as create a username and password to log in. Being logged in allows users to add Pokemon cards to their own collection.

I created this project to learn how to integrate front-end and back-end.

### TO DO

-   add testing
-   connect users to specific collections
